jRoot Analysis Tools for Spectroscopy
======
The jROOT package is a plugin library for CERN's [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework, which adds a number of useful tools and graphical user interface designed to create a environment for fast manipulation and analyse of spectroscopic data.
The main tools are; a fitting environment specifically designed for the fitting of strongly tailed Gaussian peaks, and a gating and background subtraction tool for 2D and 3D histograms.
Together these tools enable quick analysis of gamma+charged-particle coincidence data from nuclear physics experiments.

The package includes a fully illustrated manual.<br>
The latest release can be downloaded from [my github](https://github.com/jsmallcombe/jRootAnalysisTools/releases).

Course Materials - Intro to Nuclear Spectroscopy with ROOT
======
This is a self contained introductory course to CERN's [ROOT](https://root.cern/) framework, specifically tailored to graduate students who will be using ROOT as a tool for nuclear spectroscopy.
The package contains a series of example codes and data files, along with detailed guide.
The guide is split into several exercises looking at different challenges of spectroscopic analysis, with problem questions scattered throughout.
Students should be able to work through the exercise book at their own pace, with their answers to the problem questions serving to monitor progress and comprehension.
Instructor files are also provided, so that a teacher who has some familiarity with ROOT may provide a brief introductory lecture to the early concepts and provide solutions to struggling students.
The course files can be [downloaded here](/files/ROOT_Intro.zip)

The course is written to avoid heavy reliance on previous knowledge of C++. However, for students with limited coding experience an explicit introduction to C++ may be necessary. This [C++ introduction](/files/C++Intro.zip). may be useful for this purpose.

SPUWU Spreadsheet
======
This spreadsheet is a handy calculator when working with reduced electric magnetic transition rate in nuclei.
It calculates relations for Weisskopf/Ramen single particle units and natural units, as well as conversions for lifetimes and nuclear matrix element.
The most recent version can be [downloaded here](/files/spu_and_wu_Smallcombe10.xlsx).
